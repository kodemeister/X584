## Building from source

1. Install C++ Builder 6.
2. Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop.
> [!NOTE]
> It looks like Microsoft removed HTML Help Workshop from their website. You can still download it from the [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200918004813/https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/A/9/0A939EF6-E31C-430F-A3DF-DFAE7960D564/htmlhelp.exe) or install it via Chocolatey.
3. Open `X584.bpr` in C++ Builder and build the project.
4. Open `Help\X584.hhp` in HTML Help Workshop and build the project.

The compiled executable and CHM help file will be located under `Build` directory.
